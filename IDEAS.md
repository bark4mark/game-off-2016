#Ideas for a game

* Hacking
* Modding
* Augmenting

1. A text based adventure game that comprises a number of challenges based around well known hacking techniques using techy
jargon, green text on black background with included ascii art.
2. A hack/slash platformer on the lines of Revenge of Shinobi.
3. A 2.5D racer (OutRunners) where you earn money for finishing in a good position and you can use the money to buy mods
for your car.
4. An augmented reality game, maybe using qrcodes, like a treasure hunt or a race.
